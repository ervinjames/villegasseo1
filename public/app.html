          <h1 class="white-text">Software Engine Optimization</h1>
          <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a web search engine's unpaid results—often referred to as "natural", "organic", or "earned" results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users; these visitors can then be converted into customers.SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, video search, academic search,news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines. SEO differs from local search engine optimization in that the latter is focused on optimizing a business' online presence so that its web pages will be displayed by search engines when a user enters a local search for its products or services. The former instead is more focused on national searches.</p>

          <h2 class="white-text">Guidelines On How to Read A Search Engine</h2>
          <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">1. Previewing pages Notice that when you use your mouse to point at a particular search result, called aresult block, a small, sideways chevron appears next to it (). Clicking on that chevron allows you to preview a document, letting you determine what kind of document is behind the link. It can help you decide whether that link meets your needs, and whether you want to visit the page. These previews, in combination with skimming results, can help you get a quick grounding in a subject. 2. Understanding an individual search result Result blocks on a search results page consist of three major elements: Title: The blue link in the top line gives you the topic of the page. Web address/URL: The second line contains a green link which tells you location of the document on the web. This line can help you determine the source of the information. Snippet: This last two lines, the black text, show you some of the places where your search terms appear on the page, embedded in the text in which they appear. A snippet is not a complete summary of the text on a page; it is only search terms in context, extracted from the document. Ellipses: In some snippets you see an ellipsis (...). Be careful about how you interpret the ellipsis. Text that is taken out and replaced by the ellipses could be critical to answering your question. 3. Using an entire results page Not only is it helpful to know how to understand a single result, but you can gain a lot from taking a moment to look over an entire screen or page full of results.</p>

          <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">Knowing only a few pages or posts on your site might ever rank well. The importance of backlinks can’t be stressed enough. Focus as much of your time as possible on the promotion of your content. It’s common for a large proportion of your overall organic search traffic to come from a very small proportion of your overall content. Without doubt, the biggest cause of failure with SEO campaigns is the assumption that simply creating great content will get you results. *Failing to adjust. Once upon a time, your first shot at SEO may have yielded solid results. Now, making a serious and strategic attempt at SEO is the starting point. I see this situation frequently, for example: if you’re not ranking for that perfect keyword yet, go after a new one. Don’t lose sight of those great keywords, but don’t sit around thinking your site will magically start ranking for it if it hasn’t yet. You have to pursue, in the meanwhile, related additional longer-tail, less competitive phrases, which help you gain ground in tackling higher trafficked terms. *SEO is more than just plugging holes. This is not as easy as plugging holes. It is more than that.SEO just takes more things coming together. You have to identify, and work the opportunities, as much as you have to plug holes. *The magic is in the maintenance. It is rarely the one-time work that will meet your goals and expectations.

DOMAIN NAME STRATEGY - is to proactively protect your brand online by reducing the chance for others to use your brand name in their online activities, specifically, in their website URLs.</p>

<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4"> 
 LINKING STRATEGY - Using anchor text to link to specific deep pages on a site, as well as the home page, can certainly help from a ranking perspective. Data still shows that we see incremental lift in associated rankings and traffic when we accomplish these tasks..</p>

      


<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
 KEYWORD STRATEGY - Using Keywords in Your Campaigns. Keyword Strategies are essential to developing winning search engine marketing campaigns. ... The best keyword strategies rely on highly relevant keywords, which are keywords that relate closely to your business or are associated with your industry.</p>

    

<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
 TITLE TAGS - are part of the meta tags that appear at the top of your HTML inside the < head> area. Think of title tags like the title of the chapter of a book. It tells people and search engines what your page is about.Title tags are also part of what makes people decide whether to visit your site when it shows up in the search results. The title tag should contain important keywords to help the search engine determine what the page is about.
</p>

      

<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
 META DESCRIPTION TAGS - The meta description tag in HTML is the 160 character snippet used to summarize a web page’s content. Search engines sometimes use these snippets in search results to let visitors know what a page is about before they click on it. In this post, we will look at how search engines use meta descriptions, what the top SEO blogs say about meta descriptions & whether they still use them, and reasons why you should use them.

<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
 ALT TAGS STRATEGY - In the murky waters of search engine optimization (SEO) rests a lot of technical terminology like meta data, title tags and backlinks. If you’re trying to get SEO in order, it can be especially overwhelming to know where to start. Fortunately, SEO is often taken piece by piece and each element contributes to an overall strategy for success. Search gurus have talked a lot about how search engines crawl and index websites and the importance of optimizing your content to increase your organic search rank. One important piece that’s often overlooked is ensuring images on your site are appropriately labeled or “tagged.” Paying attention to the alternative text (often referred to as alt tags or alt attributes) can increase your chances of search engine success. 
Most importantly, alt tags provide a description of an image for those who have disabilities and rely on screen readers to navigate the Web. This is a great example of the importance of writing Web content for people and not for search engine robots. Usability and relevance to your users should always be at the forefront of your efforts. In SEO terms, alt tags make it possible for search engines to properly read and understand what an image is conveying. In other words, it’s one more element on your site for search engines to crawl and another chance for you to infuse your keywords (assuming the image is relevant to your keywords). It will also help you think more strategically about the images on your page to make sure you’re maximizing your targeted keywords.

SEARCH ENGINE INDEXING - Returning the results for short tail keywords might be an easy job for search engines.But now as the trend is towards long tail keywords, search engines have a doctored a difference indexing mechanism for returning results for long tail keywords.The indexing mechanism is latent semantic indexing. In latent semantic indexing search engines, determine the relationship between different entities or part of a blog content. By understanding this relationship between different entities, search engines understand the context meaning of the blog content easily.Once the content is understood properly by search engines, it is easy for them to return accurate results for long tail keywords.Search engine users started to give more complex search queries than never before. Therefore, the search engines have developed the technique of processing natural language search queries.Because of this algorithm, Google Graph Search came into existence. Search engines like Google are now returning the results or answers for the search queries straight away without leading us to other blog content.As a conclusion, I can say that, the algorithm used by search engines for processing long tail search queries is Latent Semantic Indexing Algorithm.

SEO or search engine optimization using the best proven strategies helps to make business websites appealing to search engines. This in turn improves the ranking and enables the website to appear among the top ranking websites on search engine result pages.

          On page SEO deals with aspects on your website that can be optimized for search engines. Off page SEO involves aspects on other websites on the internet that can be optimized to improve the ranking of your website on leading search engines. It’s important to understand the difference between on page and off page SEO.

          As an IT Student, I can see a huge difference between On page and Off page is that Both were giving results to clients upon searchng but OFF page rely on another link to see result while On Page has all the result within a single page.

 <h2 class="white-text">On Page SEO Techniques</h2>
          <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">On page SEO is what you do on your own website or blog in order to enhance the traffic. It is the first thing that every webmaster should look into. On page optimization needs constant revision of the site in order to improve and maintain the ranking. In this technique, the role of keywords or key phrases that the user might type has a prominent position. It includes headings, page titles, domain names and images. But all these elements have to be search-engine friendly. The size of the site should not be too large or too small. It should have genuine, interesting and relevant content. The main components involved in on-page optimization are listed below:

– Headings
– Title of the page
– Meta description and tags
– Image and pictures
– URL structure and domain information
– User-friendly navigation and quick loading
– Fresh and quality content
– Optimized external and internal links

Let us consider some of the important on page optimization techniques:

Title optimization

The most important web optimization element is the title tag. The title tag should be a short but descriptive one, which will help the visitors learn more about you and your business. The title tag is indexed on the search engines, so the title tag has greater importance than other components. Your title should be good enough to attract users looking for specific information.

Meta tag

Meta tag is a short description about your website, its focus areas and the services you provide. In the Meta tag it’s important that the title, keyword and descriptions written are distinct from other sites.

Content writing

Content writing is a very important feature to drive more traffic to your site.Regularly updating your content with fresh information, and appropriate keywords and phrases increases the ranking of your site. Good content is important for your articles, newspaper, blogs, and press releases as well.

Keyword optimization

Adding keywords to your site is important but keyword stuffing can make your site unreadable.

Link optimization

Proper link building improves your site’s quality. There should be effective external and internal links to secure high-ranking in search engines. The link should be taken from a genuine and unique site.

Image optimization

Image optimization can make your site unique but it should be done according to certain criteria. The first one is the file size and loading speed of an individual image and the second is proper file naming and optimization. Search engine spiders can only read text and not images, so special tags are used to make them comprehensible to search engines.

Off page SEO

Unlike on page optimization, off page depends on another web page to improve your site or blog. Off-page optimization deals with link building factors. It’s an ongoing process and needs regular new links that are given priority by search engines. In this technique if you obtain a high quality link, then your site can rank higher. Strategic link building increases the traffic to your website and its position in Google.

Off page SEO is a combination of social media, social bookmarking and link building.

          <h3 class="white-text">SEO ON PAGE TECHNIQUES</h3>
          <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">

There are many people who are just starting to blog and many more that have run their own site for a while, that don’t know what SEO is and how to implement it!
SEO simply stands for Search Engine Optimisation. This is where you construct your web pages and implement certain techniques to help you rank as high as possible on search engine result pages (SERPs). The higher your pages can rank on Google/Bing/Yahoo/etc. results pages, the more traffic your site is likely to get.
Now, SEO can be split up into two separate categories; On-Page SEO & Off-Page SEO.
On-Page SEO refers to all the things that you can do ON your website to help you rank higher, such as page titles, internal linking, meta tags & descriptions, etc.
Off-Page SEO refers to all the things that you can do directly OFF your website to help you rank higher, such as social networking, article submission, forum & blog marketing, etc.
In today’s post we will be looking specifically at On-Page SEO and some of the most effective ways to increase your page rankings on search engines.


<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
 1. PAGE TITLES
Your page titles are one of the most important SEO factors on your site. Each of your pages & posts should have its own unique title, which includes the main keywords for that page.
For example, you could write a blog post about a new chocolate cake recipe that you have tried. It is therefore vitally important that you include ‘Chocolate Cake Recipe’ within your post title, perhaps “Easy Chocolate Cake Recipe” or “ Chocolate Cake Recipe for kids”, etc.
This way, whenever someone searches for Chocolate Cake Recipes in a search engine, your post has a better chance of showing up because you have included those keywords.
</p>


<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
 2. META DESCRIPTIONS
Many people forget to include meta descriptions for their pages. These descriptions are an important place to include relevant keywords for your content, as these are used within the search results when your page is listed.
For instance, if we continue to use the ‘Chocolate Cake Recipe’ example, then a good meta description for that page would include those keywords and related ones. So, “This easy chocolate cake recipe is possibly the most delicious, mouth watering, chocolatey cake ever made.” would be a great meta description to use, as it is relatively short, whilst containing a number of specific keywords.
</p>
<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
 3. META TAGS
For each of your pages, you can include a set of keywords in the form of meta tags. These should be all the relevant keywords of your content, which you will have researched previously.
I use a WordPress plug-in on my sites called ‘All In One SEO Pack’. This allows me to enter all of my meta tag keywords, meta description and page title at the bottom of each of my posts before publishing. This simply inserts all of the information into your page HTML format for you, making your life a little easier.
</p>



   
<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
 4. URL STRUCTURE
Including search engine friendly URLs for each of your pages is highly recommended, as these bring better crawling. Shorter URLs seem to perform better in search engine results, however that is not the only factor.
URLs that include targeted keywords, also perform better. The location of these keywords can also be a major influence. For example site.com/keyword would perform better than site.com/365/738/subfolder/keyword etc.
As you can see for this page, the URL is http://onlineincometeacher.com/traffic/on-page-seo-techniques/ I have included the keywords that are relevant for this post.
</p>

   <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
 5. BODY TAGS (H1, H2, H3, H4, etc.)
When writing your articles, you should break up your content into smaller sections & paragraphs to make it easier for people to read. These sections can be given heading, which is where H1, H2, H3, H4, etc. tags are used.
Generally H1 tags are reserved for your main page title, with subsequent headings (just like the ones I have used throughout this post) being issued H2, H3, etc. Search engines use these to determine what is important within your content. This is why keyword rich headines are more useful than generic ones. Make sure you write keyword rich headings in the order of priority in H1, H2 and H3 title tags. They are used by many crawlers to differentiate important content.
</p>

  
     <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
6. KEYWORD DENSITY
Including relevant keywords throughout your content is very important, as it helps search engines work out what your content is about. However, try not to excessively repeat and overuse keywords just for search engine robots. This can lead to your site being banned from search engines.
To avoid this, try to keep your keyword density to roughly 2-5%. If you find this hard, get out a thesaurus and broaden your writing vocabulary. This way, you are still writing about the same thing, without risk of being banned.
</p>
  <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
7. IMAGE SEO
Using images within your content is a great way to make your site more visually appealing and break up boring chunks of text. You can utilise these images to help improve your site SEO.
All your uploaded images have titles, so treat them just the same as your page titles. Including relevant keywords can help people find your site when searching on Google Images.
You can also include Alt Text and Descriptions for your images, making them even more useful with SEO.
</p>
<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
8. INTERNAL LINKING
People often think that the only links that count are those from other websites. While these links are important, these are not the only important links!
Placing links to your other website pages, is a great way of improving your site and used properly, internal links can be a useful weapon in your SEO arsenal. Not only does it make it much easier for your visitors to navigate around your site and find all of your content, but it also ensures that your site gets properly crawled allowing the search engines to find all of your pages. It also helps to build the relevancy of a page to relevant keywords and phrases, whilst also helping to increase the Google PageRank of your pages.
There are a number of different methods that you can use to improve your internal linking structure. The main being; content links and permanent navigation links.
For bloggers, content links are very useful when used properly. These are links that are placed within your article posts, which redirect people to other relevant pages on your site. For example, this post is focused on increasing traffic to your site, so readers may also find a post on ‘How To Drive Traffic To Your Blog‘ useful. Perhaps other people are just starting out blogging and want to learn more.
</p>


<h3 class="white-text">SUMMARY</h3>
          <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">

These 8 techniques are just some of the ways that you can improve your on-page SEO. Any one used independently of the others won’t make much difference to your site ranking, however when used together, they can help to improve your site traffic.
They will help to get your pages working better, they will help to get your entire site crawled by search engine spiders, they will help increase the value of internal pages and they will build the relevancy of internal pages to specific keyword phrases.
So, it pays to spend some time implementing these to improve your site! Please leave your comments below & feel free to ask any questions.

          <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">

TThe battle for awesome organic rankings is waged on two distinct fronts: what Google finds on your pages (on page SEO), and what it hears other websites “say” about your page (off page SEO).

On page factors are typically the easiest to affect, because they’re driven by your pages’ content and behavior.

These ranking signals include the length of your content, its relevance for certain keyword phrases, how many people click on your page in search results, how long people spend on your page, and searchers’ behavior after they’ve visited your page.

Off page ranking, however, often requires more creativity, ingenuity, and technical prowess to do well.

To parse off page rankings, Google looks primarily at the websites that are linking back to a page. If these sites are high quality and authoritative, it stands to reason that your page is valuable.

So, how do we make an impact on what happens on websites operated by complete strangers?

These five techniques for off page SEO (that marketers can tackle on their own) will give you the most return on your investment of time and effort.

Off Page Technique #1: Guest Posting

Guest blogging is ranked number one on this list because it’s such a versatile strategy. It gets you very high quality backlinks, but it also increases your site’s exposure and authority to a wider audience.

As a bonus, guest posts can also drive referral traffic to your own articles or landing pages, which means they can be a lead generation source in addition to these other great outcomes.

The downside to guest posting is that it can be time consuming.

Brian Dean of Backlinko offers five detailed steps in his Definitive Guide to Guest Blogging, most of which have sub-steps involved:

 2.BROKEN LINK BUILDING - This is kind of like guest posting’s little brother. You get similar outcomes in terms of SEO benefit because you’re working to create backlinks on relevant, authoritative sites, but you’re usually not creating something from scratch to earn each new link.

The idea behind this off page SEO technique is that there are broken links littering the internet, and you’re going to be the good Samaritan who offers to help fix them.

All you ask in exchange is that those broken links be replaced with a link to some of your content. Seems fair, right?

But, like its big brother guest posting, this technique requires you to invest time to get the SEO payoff. The steps are also similar:

Identify Relevant Sites with Broken Links. Neil Patel’s Step by Step Guide to Modern Broken Link Building offers many great tools to help with this complicated process.
Find Your Content that Fits the Broken Links. You may be able to use existing content for some broken links, but in other cases you’ll have to make something from scratch.
Reach Out With Your Correction Offer. Again, use Neil’s email template to contact webmasters or editors. Bad emails will make your earlier efforts useless because no one will take you seriously.
Track Your Results. Not everyone will let you know they’ve used your link, so you want to keep track of which sites take you up on your offer and which ones don’t. You’ll also need to keep an eye on ROI to make sure this technique is paying off.
I recommend this off page SEO technique if you’ve got an existing stock of great content you can offer links to, or you’re a highly prolific content team that can create useful resources on the fly. Otherwise, you’ll need to plan pretty far in advance to create the resources needed to offer replacements for broken links and this strategy becomes harder to execute effectively.

 3.UNIQUE SEARCH RESULTS- A single piece of original research produced by the Content Marketing Institute has produced over 6,200 backlinks in just over six months. Wouldn’t it be great if you could earn that kind of coverage?

Well, you can. All you need is a survey and some people to take it.

Ok, it’s a little bit more complicated than that, but compared to the previous two off page SEO techniques, the payoff time can be shorter and the project easier to complete.

The six steps that our survey team has outlined are:

Determine Survey’s Goals and Audience. You want to make sure your results are interesting to the people you’re hoping to reach, so pick a goal and audience before you write a single question.
Find People to Take Your Survey. Whether it’s through email, social media, or a paid panel, get a group of respondents together to answer your questions.
Design the Survey. Be considerate of your audience’s time and balance their needs with your desire to collect data.
Distribute and Monitor Results. Keep an eye on your responses in real time. You don’t want to collect a ton of data only to realize some questions weren’t set up correctly.
Create Unique Content. The authority PDF is the ultimate piece of research content, but you can easily produce infographics, slide shares, and guest posts (see technique #1) with your results.
Amplify the Reach. As with all content marketing, you should be prepared to spend as much time and money on distribution and amplification as you do on the content itself.

 4.INFOGRAPHICS- As with unique research, infographics represent the intersection between visual interest, helpful information, and novelty that makes them prime link targets.

Unbounce reported that the volume of searches related to infographics went up 800% in just two years, and they will continue to be a hugely successful content type as visual social media like Instagram and Pinterest explode.

The problem with infographics is that it’s very easy to get them wrong.

Many marketers have design skills that they can tap into the make infographics on their own, but others will want to consider outsourcing this type of content production. You definitely don’t want to invest time and resources into visual content that nobody links to. Ever.

 5. ON PAGE OPTIMIZATION -  It may seem a little bit like cheating to include on page optimization in a list of off page SEO techniques, but the harsh reality is that if your site isn’t user-friendly and mobile-optimized, all the back links in the world won’t save you from SEO destruction.

By some estimates, as much as 30% of your on page “score” comes from usability factors, such as the design and quality of your page as measured by user engagement.

Give your back links the best chance of having an impact by creating a nice, friendly site for them to link to.
