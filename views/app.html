          <h5 class="white-text">Software Engine Optimization</h5>
          <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a web search engine's unpaid results—often referred to as "natural", "organic", or "earned" results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users; these visitors can then be converted into customers.SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, video search, academic search,news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines. SEO differs from local search engine optimization in that the latter is focused on optimizing a business' online presence so that its web pages will be displayed by search engines when a user enters a local search for its products or services. The former instead is more focused on national searches.</p>

          <h5 class="white-text">Guidelines On How to Read A Search Engine</h5>
          <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">1. Previewing pages Notice that when you use your mouse to point at a particular search result, called aresult block, a small, sideways chevron appears next to it (). Clicking on that chevron allows you to preview a document, letting you determine what kind of document is behind the link. It can help you decide whether that link meets your needs, and whether you want to visit the page. These previews, in combination with skimming results, can help you get a quick grounding in a subject. 2. Understanding an individual search result Result blocks on a search results page consist of three major elements: Title: The blue link in the top line gives you the topic of the page. Web address/URL: The second line contains a green link which tells you location of the document on the web. This line can help you determine the source of the information. Snippet: This last two lines, the black text, show you some of the places where your search terms appear on the page, embedded in the text in which they appear. A snippet is not a complete summary of the text on a page; it is only search terms in context, extracted from the document. Ellipses: In some snippets you see an ellipsis (...). Be careful about how you interpret the ellipsis. Text that is taken out and replaced by the ellipses could be critical to answering your question. 3. Using an entire results page Not only is it helpful to know how to understand a single result, but you can gain a lot from taking a moment to look over an entire screen or page full of results.</p>

          <h5 class="white-text">List Some Important SEO expectations</h5>
          <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">Knowing only a few pages or posts on your site might ever rank well. The importance of backlinks can’t be stressed enough. Focus as much of your time as possible on the promotion of your content. It’s common for a large proportion of your overall organic search traffic to come from a very small proportion of your overall content. Without doubt, the biggest cause of failure with SEO campaigns is the assumption that simply creating great content will get you results. *Failing to adjust. Once upon a time, your first shot at SEO may have yielded solid results. Now, making a serious and strategic attempt at SEO is the starting point. I see this situation frequently, for example: if you’re not ranking for that perfect keyword yet, go after a new one. Don’t lose sight of those great keywords, but don’t sit around thinking your site will magically start ranking for it if it hasn’t yet. You have to pursue, in the meanwhile, related additional longer-tail, less competitive phrases, which help you gain ground in tackling higher trafficked terms. *SEO is more than just plugging holes. This is not as easy as plugging holes. It is more than that.SEO just takes more things coming together. You have to identify, and work the opportunities, as much as you have to plug holes. *The magic is in the maintenance. It is rarely the one-time work that will meet your goals and expectations. When you lay the SEO foundation on your website—selecting keywords, undergoing the rigorous, yet important minutiae of on-page optimization, redirecting and site speed and other technical obstacles—that used to be all it took. Today, it is the starting point. *Reality checking your budget. do you have the time and money to invest? It will require a mix of both. And when I say “both” I mean “both.” You cannot get results by throwing money at the problem. SEO, especially initially, requires an investment of dollars and a mix of people of strategists, tactical doers, and purse-string holders.</p>

The difference of seo and sem is that seo optimizes search engine to give the best results to clients while the sem has a marketing process with a goal of getting more visibility in search engines either by getting more free traffic or paid traffic engines which means it gives results but more likely to deal with business to clients and encourages clients to buy product selling on the internet.</p>

          <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
DOMAIN NAME STRATEGY - is to proactively protect your brand online by reducing the chance for others to use your brand name in their online activities, specifically, in their website URLs.</p>

<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4"> 
 LINKING STRATEGY - Using anchor text to link to specific deep pages on a site, as well as the home page, can certainly help from a ranking perspective. Data still shows that we see incremental lift in associated rankings and traffic when we accomplish these tasks..</p>

      


<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
 KEYWORD STRATEGY - Using Keywords in Your Campaigns. Keyword Strategies are essential to developing winning search engine marketing campaigns. ... The best keyword strategies rely on highly relevant keywords, which are keywords that relate closely to your business or are associated with your industry.</p>

    

<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
 TITLE TAGS - are part of the meta tags that appear at the top of your HTML inside the < head> area. Think of title tags like the title of the chapter of a book. It tells people and search engines what your page is about.Title tags are also part of what makes people decide whether to visit your site when it shows up in the search results. The title tag should contain important keywords to help the search engine determine what the page is about.
</p>

      

<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
 META DESCRIPTION TAGS - The meta description tag in HTML is the 160 character snippet used to summarize a web page’s content. Search engines sometimes use these snippets in search results to let visitors know what a page is about before they click on it. In this post, we will look at how search engines use meta descriptions, what the top SEO blogs say about meta descriptions & whether they still use them, and reasons why you should use them.
</p>

        

<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">
 ALT TAGS STRATEGY - In the murky waters of search engine optimization (SEO) rests a lot of technical terminology like meta data, title tags and backlinks. If you’re trying to get SEO in order, it can be especially overwhelming to know where to start. Fortunately, SEO is often taken piece by piece and each element contributes to an overall strategy for success. Search gurus have talked a lot about how search engines crawl and index websites and the importance of optimizing your content to increase your organic search rank. One important piece that’s often overlooked is ensuring images on your site are appropriately labeled or “tagged.” Paying attention to the alternative text (often referred to as alt tags or alt attributes) can increase your chances of search engine success. 
Most importantly, alt tags provide a description of an image for those who have disabilities and rely on screen readers to navigate the Web. This is a great example of the importance of writing Web content for people and not for search engine robots. Usability and relevance to your users should always be at the forefront of your efforts. In SEO terms, alt tags make it possible for search engines to properly read and understand what an image is conveying. In other words, it’s one more element on your site for search engines to crawl and another chance for you to infuse your keywords (assuming the image is relevant to your keywords). It will also help you think more strategically about the images on your page to make sure you’re maximizing your targeted keywords.

SEARCH ENGINE INDEXING - Returning the results for short tail keywords might be an easy job for search engines.But now as the trend is towards long tail keywords, search engines have a doctored a difference indexing mechanism for returning results for long tail keywords.The indexing mechanism is latent semantic indexing. In latent semantic indexing search engines, determine the relationship between different entities or part of a blog content. By understanding this relationship between different entities, search engines understand the context meaning of the blog content easily.Once the content is understood properly by search engines, it is easy for them to return accurate results for long tail keywords.Search engine users started to give more complex search queries than never before. Therefore, the search engines have developed the technique of processing natural language search queries.Because of this algorithm, Google Graph Search came into existence. Search engines like Google are now returning the results or answers for the search queries straight away without leading us to other blog content.As a conclusion, I can say that, the algorithm used by search engines for processing long tail search queries is Latent Semantic Indexing Algorithm.
